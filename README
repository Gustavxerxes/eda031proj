CPP - A News System Implementation
---------------------------------------
Written by Viktor, Niklas and Martin.


Dependencies and prerequisites
----------------------------------
The system is tested on ubuntu 12.04 and later. The non-volatile version of the server is uses the Oracle MySQL C++ connector. If the connector isnâ€™t already installed on your system run this in the terminal on an ubuntu machine in order to install it:
sudo apt-get install mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev libmysqlcppconn-dev



How to build
----------------------------------
The main directory includes a makefile and a src directory with all the source files.
To make the executables zerver, zerver-sql and client simply run the makefile.

How to run
----------------------------------
Once the programs are buildt, there should be 3 executable files in the bin folder, these are:

zerver
------------
This is the volatile version of the newsgroup server. Once the program is shut down, all created content will be lost. The syntax to start the server is:

./zerver <portnumber>


zerver-sql
------------
This version of the newsgroup server saves and loads data to a SQL database. In order for the server to work the database must first be created, this is done using databaseSetup.sql script-file included in the main directory. Once the database is initialized the server is started using the syntax:

./zerver-sql <portnumber> <username> <password> <url> <database>


client
-----------
    The client interfaces the user with the newsgroup server
It is self explaining and presents a helpful text on startup
The syntax to start the server is:

./client <url> <portnumber>
